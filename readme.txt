The code contains mainly two different functions for search,
first one for uninformed search using a Uniform Cost Search 
and informed search using A star search.

Apart from these two functions we have one read input file function to read the input file ,
read heuritic file function to read the heuristic file when we do informed search and 
we have generated path function to dispkay the result of the search.

To run the code type:
python find_route.py input_file source destination heuristic_file (for informed search) 

python find_route.py input_file source destination (for uninformed search)


Code finds a route if present and if route is not present it displays distance as infinity.
